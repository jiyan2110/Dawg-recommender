You befriend him.\u201d The dense, harsh coat is described as \u201cneat but shaggy\u201d and comes in several colors; the gait is light and confident. They can be willful and domineering, but mostly Affens are loyal, affectionate, and always entertaining. Affen people say they love being owned by their little monkey dogs. The Affenpinscher: loyal, curious, and famously amusing; this almost-human toy dog is fearless out of all proportion to his size. As with all great comedians, it\u2019s the Affenpinscher\u2019s apparent seriousness of purpose that makes his antics all the more amusing.",

Their work drive and energy, the patience it takes to train them for things other than coon hunting, and their loud, ringing bark can make the breed a bad fit as house pets for novice owners. Some passionate fans of American English Coonhounds feel that without a sporting outlet for this breed\u2019s houndy virtues, you\u2019re simply wasting a good dog. These sleek and racy, lean but muscular hounds work dusk to dawn in pursuit of the wily raccoon. The sight of the American English Coonhound tearing through the moonlit woods, all sinew and determination, bawling their lusty night music, is coon-hunter heaven.",

The smooth S-shaped contours, deep chest, and aerodynamic head mark the Azwakh as a member of the sighthound family, canine sprinters that rely on keen vision and blazing speed to fix and course their prey. The ultrafine coat comes in several colors and patterns. The overall look of this leggy hound is one of elegance and fineness, but don\u2019t be fooled: This is a tough, durable hunter who\u2019s been chasing gazelle across the scorching sands of the Sahara for more than a thousand years. Tall and elegant, the Azawakh is a West African sighthound who originates from the countries of Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. The Azawakh has a short, fine coat which may come in any color or color combinations: red, clear sand to fawn, brindled, parti-color (which may be predominulltly white), blue, black and brown. The head may have a black mask and there may be white markings on the legs, bib and at the tip of tail. There are no color or marking disqualifications in the breed. Befitting its heritage, the Azawakh excels as a companion, guardian and a lure courser in the United States.",

But lately, the wider world has discovered that the Boykin is as delightful at home as he is eager at the lake. \u201cThey are very, very sweet dogs to have around the family,\u201d a longtime owner says, \u201cbut an absolute tiger in the field.\u201d A medium-sized flushing and retrieving dog known for its rich brown coat, the Boykin Spaniel is avid, eager, merry, and trainable. This mellow housedog and tenacious bird dog was once South Carolina\u2019s best-kept secret.",

His nickname was \u201cthe butcher\u2019s dog,\u201d as he was often seen lying at the doorsteps of butcher shops. He was a protector of the home and a herder and guard dog of cattle at the farm and in the city\u2019s markets. Today, his size is the only thing that keeps intruders at bay. The Broholmer has a heart of gold, loves to snuggle, and always wants to be near you, though his preference is to sit on you. He is an excellent dog with children and other dogs, though because he seems to underestimate his size, supervision is recommended. This breed is also remarkably agile for his size and can do agility, fetch balls, and jump and catch frisbees.

The breed\u2019s hallmark is a long, egg-shaped head with erect and pointed ears, and small, triangular eyes that glisten with good humor. Coats come in two types: white; and any other color (including an attractive brindle striping), either solid or with white markings. A well-made BT is the picture of muscular determination and balance. There are four keys to BT happiness: early socialization with dogs and people; firm but loving training; ample exercise; and lots of quality time with his adored humans. If these requirements are met, there is no more loyal, lovable, and entertaining companion. This is the ultimate \u201cpersonality breed.\u201d Among the most comical and mischievous citizens of dogdom, the Bull Terrier is playful and endearing, sometimes stubborn, but always devoted.

Today, they can still be found living wild near the Georgia-South Carolina border, but have also been seen as far north as Ohio and Pennsylvania and as far west as Arizona; rural areas are the common denominator. The typical Carolina dog has pointed ears, a fox-like snout and a tail that curves like a fishhook when it is raised. They look similar to Australian Dingoes but, taxonomically, they fall under canis familiaris. Hesitant with strangers, they will sound the alarm when unaware of who\u2019s at the door, but once they see their people, they are ecstatic. Carolina Dogs have an extreme pack mentality, as this was a necessity for survival in the wild. Club Contact DetailsClub: Carolina Dog Club of AmericaName: Lane Watkins, PresidentEmail: president@thecarolinadogclubofamerica.com Carolina Dogs are generally shy and suspicious in nature, but once a dog accepts a human into its pack, those behaviors disappear toward that human. A sighthound of medium build, they have the general appearance of a jackal or wolf.",

The erect ears and full, luminous eyes are acutely expressive. Coats come in many colors and patterns, and can be long or short. The varieties are identical except for coat.Chihuahuas possess loyalty, charm, and big-dog attitude. Even tiny dogs require training, and without it this clever scamp will rule your household like a little Napoleon. Compact and confident, Chihuahuas are ideal city pets. They are too small for roughhousing with kids, and special care must be taken in cold weather, but Chihuahuas are adaptable\u2014as long as they get lots of quality time in their preferred lap. The Chihuahua is a tiny dog with a huge personality. A national symbol of Mexico, these alert and amusing \"purse dogs\" stand among the oldest breeds of the Americas, with a lineage going back to the ancient kingdoms of pre-Columbian times.",

Bred to be an independent hunter of dangerous prey, they can be brave to the point of rashness, and a bit stubborn, but their endearing nature and unique look has won millions of hearts the world over. The famously long, low silhouette, ever-alert expression, and bold, vivacious personality of the Dachshund have made him a superstar of the canine kingdom. Dachshunds come in two sizes and in three coat types of various colors and patterns.",

        "description": "The Drent is \u201cpar excellence\u201d for hunting a variety of game on diverse terrain. He is known for keeping in touch with the hunter; when on point, while awaiting the hunter, the dog will often look back at his hunting partner if it takes a long time to wait. His adaptability makes him suitable for all manner of game in the field as well as in the water. The Drent is also known to be a good retriever. Due to the Drent\u2019s soft nature, forceful training methods are inappropriate. The dog is expected to bark to announce visitors to the home, and is often reserved towards strangers until welcomed. He is loyal, intelligent and a pet of exceptional value on top of being a good hunting buddy. Club Contact DetailsClub: Drentsche Patrijshond Club of North AmericaName: Brian O\u2019ConnorEmail: dpcna.gundogs@gmail.comPhone: 208-590-0027 This breed is pronounced da'rinse-ah puh'trice-hoon. The Drentsche Patrijshond, Drent for short, is not your typical continental pointer. For starters, the Drent has a tail and is nearly four hundred years old. The Drent was built by farmers for farmers. As a farm dog, Drents had to do it all: hunt feather and fur, keep the farm clear of vermin, cart dairy to the market and much more. The breed has maintained versatility from the beginning and are highly intelligent and adaptable. As such, training must be kept lively and interesting. Drents are used in all types of hunting, agility, tracking, dog sledding, and skijoring.",

Hunting deer was difficult due to terrain and herd locations so hunters soon realized the benefits of using this short-legged, long-bodied dog to drive the deer over long distances and rough terrain right to them. A keen and even-tempered hound, the Drever is never aggressive, nervous or shy. They are content in most living situations, but tend to be vocal when alerting or at play. The Drever is robust and strong rather than elegant and speedy. They have a proud carriage, well-developed muscles and agile appearance. Affectionate, playful, and sweet, the Drever gets along well with most other breeds and is great in groups.",

It was developed as an all-purpose farm dog, working originally as a farm guard, drover, and livestock dog. A well known dog fancier wrote about the Dutch Shepherd in 1910: \u201c\u2026bearing a great resemblance to the wolf.\u201d Of course this is not entirely true, but it is another aspect that shows that the Dutch Shepherd still has many of the characteristics of its wild forebears. Although it is not a widely known breed, the Dutch Shepherd is a loyal companion and competent working dog used for obedience, dog sports, herding, tracking, search and rescue, and as a police dog. The Dutch Shepherd is a lively, athletic, alert and intelligent breed, and has retained its herding instinct for which it was originally developed. Having an independent nature, it can be slightly obstinate and have a mind of its own. Since its original duties were to keep flocks of sheep in a particular location, it is able to run all day, and that is reflected in its physique and structure.",

Particularly impressive is his strong, mane-like collar around his neck, called a ruff, and the bushy tail carried boldly over his back. His foxy head, alert eyes, and small, pointed, closely-set ears give the German Spitz his unique cheeky appearance. His coat comes in a variety of colors including white, black, cream, gold, black and tan, sable, and chocolate brown. Though easily trainable, this lively and intelligent breed can also have an independent streak. If properly trained (so as not to be too noisy) and well socialized, the German Spitz will be happy mingling with other people and dogs. The German Spitz is always attentive, lively and exceptionally devoted to his owner. He is very teachable and easy to train. His distrust towards strangers and lack of hunting instinct make him the ideal watchdog for the home. His indifference to weather, robustness and longevity are his most outstanding attributes.",

        "description": "Hamiltonstovare are most commonly multi-purpose dogs; they are hunters, show dogs, and pets, all in one regal and versatile little package. As a hound, they follow their nose wherever it goes (and will not return for a good long while), so leashes and fences are a necessity with this breed. Unlike most scent hounds though, the Hamiltonstovare has an extremely high prey drive for both scent and sight. They can make excellent lure coursing dogs. In the home, they are a lazy, low maintenullce dog who rarely sheds. Very food motivated, they can be easy to train despite their hound stubbornness, but higher competitive obedience levels are not usually an option. The only major problem with this breed is accessibility; there is only one breeder of Hamiltonstovare in the United States. Unfortunately, Hamiltonstovare have a rescue problem in the US as well, and some can be found in rural shelters in Virginia, North Carolina, West Virginia, Kentucky, South Carolina and Tennessee. Club Contact DetailsClub: Hamiltonstovare Club of AmericaName: Ashley HammockEmail: OceaniaHamilton@hotmail.comAddress: 2311 Chapel Hill Rd, Goochland, Va 23063 The Hamiltonstovare is a versatile scent hound, bred to hunt hare and fox in Sweden. When not hunting, they can be found in the show ring, as their striking color makes them a stunning show dog. Hamiltons have been used as service dogs in America since the late 90s, where their versatility and close bond with their people shine.",

His broad, deep chest provides ample room for the lungs and enables long, strenuous chases. The slightly wrinkled forehead and the clear, dark eyes produce the serious expression typical of the Hanoverian Scenthound. Also typical for the breed is the red primary color of the coat, which can vary from a pale fawn color to a dark brindle, appearing almost black. The Hanoverian Scenthound has a calm and assured temperament, at the same time sensitive with his handler, and choosy and discerning with strangers.

They are excellent swimmers and climbers and have been known to climb trees and swim rivers in pursuit of game. Kai have a distinct brindle coat that comes in three colors: Black Brindle (Kuro-Tora), Brindle (Chu-Tora), and Red Brindle (Aka-Tora). Red brindle is the rarest of the coat colors. The distinct coloring and brindle pattern enabled the dog to blend in to the mountainous forests in which it hunted, camouflaging it against prey and predators in ancient times. The amount of brindle will vary from dog to dog as well as the brindle pattern. Most puppies are born completely black and their brindle will emerge as they age and will continue to change for around the first five years of their life. In the home, the Kai Ken requires basic canine care. They can be kept in an apartment setting provided they receive regular exercise in the form of leashed walks. Being a naturally clean breed, bathing should be limited to only when dirty. Brushing is recommended, especially during twice-a-year coat blowing.

        "description": "The Karelian Bear Dog is a medium-sized spitz with a dense coat. Bred to hunt large, aggressive game by himself, his build reflects his duties. He is a silent hunter, and only barks once the game is stopped or treed. Working with an experienced hunter, he communicates the type of animal he has located by the sound of his bark. Though he can demonstrate self-control around people, his fighting spirit surfaces around other dogs and can be difficult to handle. His spirit easily turns into aggression, as Karelian Bear Dogs love a challenge. Club Contact DetailsClub: American Karelian Bear Dog AllianceName: Maureen GriffinEmail: nytwind@comcast.netPhone: 860-434-9198 The Karelian Bear Dog is an eager hunter and very independent, yet works cooperatively to mark game by barking. Their senses, especially smell, are sharp, thus the breed is suitable for big game hunting. They have a very good sense of direction, are balanced, courageous and persistent. This breed has a highly developed spirit for game and are very self-confident. They may be territorial towards other males, but are never aggressive towards people, though they may be slightly reserved.",

Few Norfolks these days earn their living hunting rodents, but a good one will fearlessly do so when given a chance. Norfolks bond closely, sometimes jealously, with their owners and make nice watchdogs. They have a reputation as a good traveler: portable, adaptable, and up for anything.

The OES breed standard says the skull is \u201ccapacious and rather squarely formed, giving plenty of room for brain power.\u201dOES move with a bear-like shuffle but are famous for their nimbleness afoot. Regular exercise is required for these strong, able-bodied workers. Equally famed are their many fine housedog qualities: watchfulness, courage, kindliness, and intelligence. Great with children, OES make patient, protective playmates. They are sensible watchdogs known for a loud, ringing bark. The Old English Sheepdog is the archetypical shaggy dog, famous for his profuse coat and peak-a-boo hairdo, a distinctive bear-like gait, and a mellow, agreeable nature. The OES is a big, agile dog who enjoys exploring and a good romp.",

PIOs come in a range of sizes: the smallest might stand just short of 10 inches; the largest top out at nearly 26 inches. Their distinguishing feature is, of course, hairlessness. The delicate skin can be a solid color or spotted with unpigmented areas. Coated PIOs are in the minority, and the coated and hairless varieties can occur in the same littler.Going by his general conformation, it is an elegant and slim dog, whose aspect expresses speed, strength and harmony without ever appearing coarse. Another particular feature is that the dentition in the hairless variety is nearly always incomplete, associated with the congenital alopecia. Noble and affectionate at home with those close to him, he is at the same time lively and alert. He might be wary of strangers and is a good watch dog. The breed is loyal and protective of his family, but like all dogs, should be supervised around younger children. Caution should also be taken with small pets that may be seen as prey. Agile, smart and swift, the Peruvian Inca Orchid is an elegant sighthound that developed in Peru. The breed can be hairless or coated, and comes in three sizes: small, medium and large. Lively and alert, these dogs can be very good hunters and do well in lure coursing, rally and agility. In the hairless variety, the skin can be of any color. In the coated variety, all colors are accepted including black, brown, gray, pink, tan and white.",

The Porcelaine is primarily a hunting dog breed, originating from a mixture of highly intelligent French and English scent hounds. That said, you must remember that any breed with a high prey drive will require careful consideration in housing and handling. Another charming aspect of the breed is that they tend to be quiet indoors or in their kennel, but do have a beautiful melodious baying call. They are not nuisance barkers. The Porcelaine is elegant, energetic, and a fierce hunter; he is used for small game, driving it to waiting guns. He is very fond of his owners, family, friends and children and he loves to take part in all family activities. He excels as a house pet and is easily crate trained and housebroken.",

They also have two coat types: smooth and wirehaired. The breed\u2019s enthusiasts describe it as \u201cprimitive,\u201d that is, it\u2019s a rustic, no-frills hound untouched by fads and fashion since arriving on the Iberian Peninsula ages ago. Among their distinctive characteristics are large, erect, triangular ears; a pyramid-shaped head that tapers to the nose; and sweetly expressive, almond-shaped eyes.Podengos, in general, are funny dogs that love to play. They easily entertain themselves with toys, chase each other and stalk each other around the house and yard. They are highly intelligent and learn new things very fast. Since they are a watchful dog though, they are not as easy going and playful with strangers and may view smaller animals like dogs and cats as prey. They may be quite reserved initially and prefer to greet strangers on their own terms. They are very tolerant and compliant, eager to please their family members and put up with most requests we make of them. Portuguese Podengos are lively, agile, playful, alert, highly intelligent but not always easy to train, independent yet loving with the family and sometimes suspicious of strangers. The breed's two sizes have different jobs: the larger hunts deer and boar and the medium-sized hunts rabbit. In the U.S, they are successful in coursing, agility, nose work, barn hunt, rally and in the conformation ring.",

Their long hair has a goat-like texture, without an undercoat, and can be straight or slightly wavy. The dense and evenly-distributed coat forms a long beard, mustache, and eyebrows that are not so long as to cover his eyes. Coat colors can be yellow, brown, grey, fawn, wolf grey in shades ranging from light to dark, and black, accompanied by tan markings. This lively breed has a simian-like attitude and appearance, which is why it is known in its native region of Portugal as a \u201cmonkey dog\u201d. The Portuguese Sheepdog is exceptionally intelligent and lively. Very devoted to the shepherd and his herd, he can be somewhat wary of strangers and vigilant at night. Today, he is also an excellent companion, sporting and guard dog. He is known for his skillful ability to keep livestock in pastures and also for searching out stray animals. He is always vigilant and successfully alerts if predators are in the area. This breed is extremely devoted to its work and conducts it with joy and pleasure.",

At the same time, he is courageous and proud towards strangers, from whom he never backs away. In his behavior towards other dogs, he is good-natured and aware of his superior strength. Though he will do his job to alert when strangers or animals come around, he is not known for being an incessant barker. As a guardian breed, the Pyrenean Mastiff has a very low prey drive and, therefore, loves and protects all creatures, human and animal alike. They love children and welcome friends and family, and only feel the need to protect when its a real threat. All that love can get a bit messy though; just like any mastiff, they do drool and quite profusely when exposed to heat, food, or water.

This may even be the couch or a carpet not suitable for dogs, but as a rule shepherds, even as puppies, prefer to sleep on hard ground. They need no dog baskets, no special mattresses and by no means an allocated place. No \u201cwork creating\u201d program is necessary but daily walks and hikes provide exciting variation.

They will dash through the house or yard chasing toys as long as you can keep up, while many others are willing to do nothing more than lounge in your lap all day long, content in knowing that they are the prize jewel in your home. They thrive on human companionship and will let you know if they are feeling neglected. Their coat is either semi-long or smooth. The longhaired variety carries a nice ruff on the chest and unique feathering on the extremities, tail and ears. Long-coated Russian Toys will not have an adult coat until it is more than a year old and full fringing not until three years of age. The smooth-coated variety is sleek and smooth to the touch. There is also a slight attitude difference between the two varieties. Smooth Coats tend to be a little more terrier-like than Long Coats. However, both share a larger-than-life personality.

Although they are quick to alert, they will not be a constant barker with early training on appropriate behavior. They are fairly independent for a toy breed and require early socialization with people. However, Bolonki do get along well with dogs and other animals. Very clever and smart, they do well in formal training such as obedience, rally, tracking and agility when trained with a firm, but gentle, hand.

Those big dark eyes looking up at you with that sweet expression! It\u2019s no surprise that Shih Tzu owners have been so delighted with this little \u201cLion Dog\u201d for a thousand years. Where Shih Tzu go, giggles and mischief follow.",

Tipping the scales at no more than 60 pounds, they are noticeably smaller and lighter than their burly cousin, the Alaskan Malamute. In fact, breeders and fanciers prefer the moniker Siberians over huskies, as the latter suggests a bigger, brawnier dog than what is the standard for the breed.As born pack dogs, Siberians enjoy family life and get on well with other dogs; their innate friendliness render them indifferent watchdogs. This breed is also energetic and can\u2019t resist chasing small animals, so secure running room is a must. An attractive feature of the breed: Siberians are naturally clean, with little doggy odor. The Siberian Husky, a thickly coated, compact sled dog of medium size and great endurance, was developed to work in packs, pulling light loads at moderate speeds over vast frozen expanses. This northern breed is friendly, fastidious, and dignified.",

        "description": "The Stabyhoun\u2019s independent nature was a deliberately bred characteristic by farmers who wanted a dog that could hunt independently for moles and rabbits. That propensity we still see today, therefore, you cannot be upset if he looks for prey independently and, for example, digs in the garden. With proper guidance, a Staby is a gentle dog and a great friend for life.Stabys are also very inquisitive. Always pay attention to what a Stabyhoun is up to because with their inquisitive nature, they can quickly get into trouble. If you think your Staby will sit quietly if something happens, you will often be disappointed. Although Stabys make a lot of noise when something is wrong or to alert his owner, they generally expect the owner to further investigate before they accept that things are normal. Most Stabys will need to verify that there are no \u201csurprises\u201d in store before calming down again.This breed is a functional and powerfully-built pointing dog that originated in the Netherlands. The majority of Stabyhouns are black and white. The brown and white coloring is seen in the Netherlands, but the orange and white Stabyhoun is nearly extinct. The Staby\u2019s build is such that it is greater in length than in height and similarly, the head shows more length than width. The feathering on his chest, collar, forelegs, trousers and tail gives the Staby the impression of being longhaired, but the coat is not excessively long. The Stabyhoun is considered to be an \u201call-around\u201d dog, with abilities in hunting, retrieving, and pointing. They are also ideal family dogs because of their size and affectionate character.

He is both a soft-mouthed retriever and a pointer that is particularly useful for hunting ducks and upland birds. He is a fine retriever, and water work is one of his fortes. He is very sharp-eyed, owns a good sense of smell and aptitude, and works fast and efficiently.",

Club Contact DetailsClub: American Teddy Roosevelt Terrier ClubName: Kaye Stevenson, PresidentEmail: Americantrtclub@gmail.comAddress: 205 Donna Dr., Montgomery, AL 36108 The Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is a lively, friendly, affectionate dog with his family but can be somewhat of a one-person dog. With his strong protective nature and well-developed pack instincts, the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier gets along well with children (when raised with them), cats, and other dogs. He is a bold, tenacious hunter with seemingly unlimited energy whose size and endurance makes him an excellent hunter of squirrels and vermin.",

        "description": "The Thai Ridgeback is a muscular, medium-sized dog with a streamlined body that makes him very agile and a natural athlete. The ridge on his back is formed by hair growing in the opposite direction from the rest of his coat and the breed has up to 8 different ridge patterns. Puppies can be born without this ridge. Coat colors include solid blue, black, red or fawn with a black mask occasionally on the red-coated dogs. Thai Ridgebacks also have spotted tongues and some even come with solid black/blue tongues. Today, most Ridgebacks are companion dogs, but they still maintain many of the same instincts for the jobs for which they were bred: hunting and guarding. They had to be independent, self-sufficient and hunt for their own food, which gave them strong survival instincts, a high prey drive, and a high level of intelligence.If well bred and properly socialized, the Thai Ridgeback can be a loyal, loving pet. As a guarding breed, they are naturally protective of their home and can be reserved and suspicious with strangers. Thai Ridgebacks will need a patient, consistent, and experienced owner with a good understanding of dog behavior; they are not for first-time dog owners.

Working far from the farm, they developed problem-solving abilities and through the centuries have become highly intelligent. The Transylvanian Hound is good-natured, courageous, and enduring.

He has been successfully used to manage a variety of stock, including reindeer, goats, cattle and of course sheep. Kelpies in Sweden have gained police dog titles and have pulled sleds. They are also being widely used as search and rescue dogs.Kelpies need companionship. Though he can be content to stay for hours on the chain, he also needs to be with you for some time each day and needs exercise, walks or games with a ball or a stick. One cannot expect this dog, which has been bred to work, to stay outside the house without any mental or physical stimulation. Inevitably, he will set about looking for an occupation, which could include chasing cars, trying to \u2018work\u2019 them as he would control sheep. A Working Kelpie makes a fine family dog, gets along well with \u2018his\u2019 children and, because they are naturally gentle, almost all Working Kelpies live peaceably with other family pets. The Working Kelpie is extremely alert, eager and highly intelligent. He possesses an open, friendly, active but placid disposition with a good balance between keenness to work and ability to relax. With an almost inexhaustible energy, the Working Kelpie has a marked loyalty and devotion to work and a strongly-inherited natural instinct and aptitude in working sheep and other livestock, both in open country and in the yards.",

        "description": "For centuries the Yakutian Laika was an irreplaceable and faithful assistant of a man in the conditions where the slightest demonstration of weakness was punished with death. It always received respectful attitude from its human family, which treated it as its member rather than a simple domestic animal. This means that it developed into a fabulous companion dog, devoted, lively and biddable. The breed is extremely gentle and considerate with children to whom it commonly establishes especially tight bonds. Nevertheless its friendly nature doesn\u2019t exclude the necessity of a certain amount of socialization, preferably at an early age.The Yakutian Laika is slightly reserved with unknown people but in most cases it\u2019s excited to acquire a new playmate. Human aggressiveness was considered by dogs\u2019 breeders as a major fault and was meticulously eliminated from its characteristics. The breed is endowed with a very sensitive nose and ears, which make it a rather capable watchdog. However its barking is no more than a means to show its anticipation of the perspective of making a new acquaintance. This dog will most likely fail in the role of a guardian due to its friendly nature.Yakutian Laikas used to pull a narta (sled) in close collaboration with dozens of other dogs, so they\u2019re quite accepting of other dogs. The breed surely prefers to have one or several constant canine companions and can be introduced with few issues to the household with a pre-existing dog, although it should be performed with necessary caution. The second primary duty of this breed was hunting and it preserves much of its prey drive. That\u2019s why its communication with other small and average-sized animals should never go unsupervised. The Yakutian Laika will most likely get on with a home cat if they have been reared together. Yakutian Laikas are used for herding, pulling sleds and hunting. They were developed in ancient times for natives of Yakutia as indispensable assistants. This versatile dog will be happy by your side or participating in agility, coursing ability, herding or sledding.",
